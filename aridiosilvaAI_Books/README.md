# Linear Algebra Algorithms Video Tutorials -  Numerical Computing with Python

### Gauss Elimination Method with Pivoting 

In this tutorial, the basic steps of Gauss Elimination (or Gaussian Elimination) method to solve  a system of linear equations are explained in details with examples, algorithms and Python codes. Gauss elimination (after Carl Friedrich Gauss, 1777-1855) is a the basis of all other elimination methods applied to solve systems of linear equations.

## Lagrange Interpolation Method: Algorithm, Computation and Plot
Lagrange interpolation (or Lagrangian interpolation) method is one of the most basic and common methods to apply the interpolation polynomials. It was named after the great mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736-1813). This tutorial explains the Lagrangian polynomial form of the interpolation function, the algorithm of the method and the Python code by using Python lists with basic for loops and by using the Numpy arrays by using conditional slicing in addition to plotting the interpolation function versus the given data points by using matplotlib.pyplot module.

## Binomial Distributions - Probabilities of Probabilities

The binomial distribution consists of the probabilities of each of the possible numbers of successes on N trials for independent events that each have a probability of π (the Greek letter pi) of occurring. For the coin flip example, N = 2 and π = 0.5.

## Normal Distribution & Probability Problems

This calculus video tutorial provides a basic introduction into normal distribution and probability.  It explains how to solve normal distribution problems using a simple chart and using calculus by evaluating the definite integral of the probability density function for a bell shaped curve or normal distribution curve.  This video contains 1 practice problem in the form of a word problem with many parts giving you plenty of examples to master this topic.  In this video, I explain how to evaluate the definite integral using wolfram's alpha online calculator for definite integrals.  You need to determine the population mean mu and standard deviation sigma as well as the lower and upper limits of integration in order to determine the probability of an event occurring within a certain range of X values where X is a continuous random variable.  You need to be familiar with the 68-95-99.7 rule.  Approximately 68% of the population lies within 1 standard deviation of the population mean or average.  95% of the population lies within 2 standard deviations of the mean and 99.7% lies within 3 standard deviations of the mean.
